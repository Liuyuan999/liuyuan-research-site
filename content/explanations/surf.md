# Why uniform weights do not give uniform trade-offs

A weight chooses a compromise. SURF asks how far that choice moves us along the Pareto front—and uses the answer to spread solutions more evenly.

## The decision

A summarization system can reward both a useful summary and a faithful one. A single weighted loss selects one compromise; a collection of models lets a user choose among compromises. The collection is useful only if it represents the front well.

## The bottleneck

An equal change in the scalarization weight can move the solution a long distance in one region and barely move it in another. Uniform preferences can therefore spend several training slots on similar models while leaving other trade-offs sparsely represented.

## The idea

Measure distance in objective space. SURF estimates how much of the front has been traversed at each weight, inverts that cumulative-distance map, and places training slots at equal distance targets. The scalarized inner solver can remain PPO, Adam, or another suitable solver.
